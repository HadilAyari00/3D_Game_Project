# 3D_Game_Project

I have taken a cartoony approach to the contest's theme.
The concept of this game is as follows: 
Our hero alien has come to earth to fight the evil trash mosters that invaded the city ! 
The trash monsters will be throwing trash in the city and trying to hit the alien with the trash. 
But thanks to the Tree-O-nator that the alien has, he will be able to change the trash monsters into trees ! 

Controls : 
zqsd for moving
space for shooting


Things added : 
- loading screen
- the ability to change camera view with your mouse
- player model and animations
- player mouvements
- player shooting projectiles
- enemies models and animations
- enemies following the player and rotating to face the player
- enemies throwing trash
- health damage and health bar
- game over screen where the game stops being active.
- trash landing on the ground and able to be picked up by the player (this isn't the case anymore as using the landscape model made it hard to see this functionality)

Issues faces : 
- initially when i made the game, I only made it using rough shapes (plain babylon ground, squares, circles, etc..), Recently when switching to 3D models, the collision detection for the ground and other aspects don't work as well, and sadly I couldn't find a solution it before today's deadline.

Things to add : 
- find a fix for collision issues due to the imported 3d models
- pollution Meter (when you let the monsters throw too much trash and the player doesn't pick it up, you'll get a game over)
- A final boss
- tweak the appearance of the game in general
